	<H1>Heating the humidity sensor and using the dewpoint</h1>
	<P>
	<B><I>The flaw:</i></b><br>
	On humidity measurements made by an Si7021 sensor the following can occur:<br>
	After some usage time, the sensor soaks up moist, and measured humidity values increase with an offset,<br>
       	measuring values to over 100.<br>
	Due to limitations in the electronic design, at 120, the Analog-to-Digital converter runs over, <br>
	and measurements are then presented as -6 and upwards, practically making the humidity measurements useless.<P>
	<B><I>The fix:</i></b><br>
	To overcome this, the humidity sensor is placed in a heated cabinet.<br>
	From the inside humidity and temperature, the dewpoint is calculated.<br>
	Inside and outside dewpoint should be the same.<br>
	For reference, the dewpoint is compared with the dewpoint measured by the KNMI (*).<br>
	Then, from the measured dewpoint and a measured outside temperature, the outside humidity is calculated.<br>
	Also this is compared against the values measured by the KNMI.<br>
	<br>
	<I>Based on a test setup built by <A HREF=https://kitt.nl/>Andries Lohmeijer</a>.</i><br>
